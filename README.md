### Article [11 Tips to Write Better Code](https://saucelabs.com/blog/11-tips-to-write-better-code)

- A good article that focus on not how to make code work, but on how to make code good. I believe this is a important part that many people ignore.
- Helped me to make my code more readable when I wrote code for projects. This really help me a lot when I try to keep track on things that I wrote.

- An interesting article that stresses the importance of makig comments. Espeically for this class where we will be collaborating on work with other students, it's important that others understand what you did. 

Oscar Xue (rx513):
- Fruitful coding advice for students in this class. It would be easier to work with other's code if all group members follow these same standards.
